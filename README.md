# RNGtarot
This is a small python app designed to simulate
tarot card readings. It will generate 3 cards of the form "X of something," X being a number from 1 to 10
and something being a word randomly selected from the included wordlist.txt file. There is a button to generate new cards. If you would like to change the app in any way the source code is included. RNGtarot.py is the class that handles the wordlist and card generation/storage while RNG_tarot.py is a tkinter app with a GUI.

To use the application, go into the "Executable" folder
and open RNG_tarot_app, it should run fine and be
intuitive to use since there's only one button. 

IMPORTANT: Make sure that RNG_tarot_app and wordlist are in the same folder together or else the app will crash.
